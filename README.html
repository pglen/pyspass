<h2>Password manager</h2>

<p>Under construction. DO NOT USE.</p>

<h2>Password generator / manager</h2>

<p>A python / PyGObject version of the popular password manager concept.</p>

<p>Generates passes from Site / Login / Serial / Master Pass</p>

<p>SHA256 strong. No passes are saved, only site, site login name and
serial number is saved.</p>

<p>The hashes are calculated at the time of master pass entry, and compared
to the checksum field. This assures that there are no sensitive items stored.</p>

<p>The only item that cannot be calculated is the pass override. (custom pass)
that is stored with AES encryption.</p>

<p>Pass is displayed as a QR code. (For your eyes only)
The default tab is for the site, the pass QR is not shown unless 'Auth' is
selected, and the master pass is successfully entered.</p>
